## 🚀 Why Do You Need It?

Using personal Telegram accounts for customer support often leads to these problems:

- Multiple agents need to share one entry point
- You don’t want to expose real personal accounts
- Conversations become messy and hard to assign
- Customer messages are easily missed
- No permission control
- Switching between multiple accounts is inefficient

VeilPassBot solves these issues with **message relay + session routing + assistant collaboration mechanisms**.
